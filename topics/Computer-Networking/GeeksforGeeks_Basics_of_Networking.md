#Basics of Computer Networking

- **Computer Network:** The interconnetcion of multiple devices, generally termed as hosts, for the purpose of sharing data.
- **Network Devices:** Router, Switch, Hub, Bridge
- **Protocol:** a set of rules or algorithms which define how two entities can communicate across the Network



#### Unique Identifiers of Network
- **Hostname:** each device in the networj is associated with a unique device name known as the Hostname
  - Coommand `hostname` in terminal, output is the hostname of the device
- **IP Address:** Number that identifies a machine on the network and across the internet
  - Command ipconfig gives us the IP address of the device
- **MAC address:** a unique indentifier of each host and is associated with the Network Interface Card. It is assigned to the NIC at the time of manufacturing
- **Port:** Logical channel through which data can be sent/received to an application
  - Any host may have multiple applications running, and each of the apps is identified using the port number on which they are running.
- **Socket:** The unique combination of IP address and Port number together termed as Socket


#### Few More Concepts
- **DNS (Domain Name Server):** A server in charge of mapping domain name humans use into ip address
